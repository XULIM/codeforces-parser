Parses the CodeForces website for problems.

## Updates
2024-06-03 12:00 - Got IP blocked for too many requests in the limited time frame. Gonna wait for a few 
days and see if I get unblocked.  
For now I have already stored parsed data in the database so I will work on the rest of the features 
and see if I get unbanned.

2024-07-10 13:57 - I am unbanned.

2024-08-12 01:34 - Got IP blocked for web scraping the actual contest problem pages.

2024-09-18 11:58 - Now using user-agents to avoid bans. Starting to refactor unnecessary OOP code into 
functional code.
